## Features
- Header with navigation buttons for easy access to different sections of the website.
- Large cover image with a translucent overlay and title for a captivating visual effect.
- "Click here" button on the cover image, triggering an alert when clicked.
- Footer with copyright information aligned to the right side.
## Code and Decisions I have made
- HTML Structure:
  The HTML file (index.html) contains the basic structure of the webpage, including header, content, and footer sections.
- CSS Styles:
  Styling for the webpage is defined in the styles.css file. Key decisions include:
- Flexbox layout:
  Flexbox is used for centering and aligning elements within the header and footer sections, providing flexibility and responsiveness to different screen sizes.
- JavaScript:
  The script.js file contains a simple function showAlert() that displays an alert when the "Click here" button is clicked. This adds interactivity to the webpage and enhances user engagement.
